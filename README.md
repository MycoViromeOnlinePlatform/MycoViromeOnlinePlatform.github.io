# 🧫 Mycovirome Platform

## Overview

The **Mycovirome Platform** is an interactive, web-based resource designed to explore the diversity, evolution, and biology of **mycoviruses** — viruses that infect fungi.  
This project focuses on *Botrytis cinerea* as a model organism, integrating global data on mycovirus sequences, genome organization, and host interactions.  

The platform combines interactive data visualizations, searchable tables, and curated biological information to support research in **virology, mycology, and plant pathology**.

## How It Works

The platform integrates multiple HTML visualizations using `<iframe>`s embedded in `index.html`:

- `mycovirome_map.html` → Global mycovirus distribution  
- `Mycovirome_plots.html` → Genome composition and prevalence  
- `virus_family_circular_plot.html` → Circular diversity plots  
- `Botrytis_Mycovirus_Dataset.html` → Searchable and filterable dataset  

These components are generated via R scripts and data visualizations.
